Steps for Viola-Jones Algorithm implementation :

*    1) cut pictures in 2 sets: train and test
*    2) for each class, create a folder of positive elements, and negative elements
*    3) Use Cascade Trainer GUI to train models on positive and negative elements, using Haar-like features
*    4) the model is ready for each class, just have to test it on the test set to compute the performances
